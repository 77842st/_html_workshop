<h1><strong>What is Sass? Your guide to this<br> top CSS preprocessor</strong></h1>

<p>By Tammy Coron January 10, 2020</p>

<h3>Discover what Sass is, and learn how to start using it.</h3>

<p><b><i>What is Sass? That's the question we here to answer. If you're new to web design, you've<br> probably heard the term floating around, but you might not be quite up to speed with exactly<br> what Sass is, what is does, and whether or not you should be using it. In short, Sass is a CSS<br> preprocessor, which adds special features such as variables, nested rules and mixins (sometimes<br> referred to as syntactic sugar) into regular CSS. The aim is to make the coding process simpler<br> and more efficient. Let's explore in more detail. </i></b></p>

<p><b><i>Article source: https://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/what-is-sass-111517618</i></b></p>

<h2><b>What is a CSS preprocessor?</b></h2>	

<p>A CSS preprocessor is a scripting language that extends CSS by allowing developers to write code<br> in one language and then compile it into CSS. Sass is perhaps the most popular preprocessor around<br> right now, but other well-known examples include Less and Stylus.</p>

<p>Before we go any further, a quick public service announcement is in order: most web designers<br> would say that if you're new to CSS, you're better off avoiding Sass (or any preprocessors,<br> extensions or frameworks) while you're still learning. While it's true they offer many advantages in<br> speed and efficiency, it's important that you really get to grips with the basics of CSS. Make sure<br> you learn the core concepts before you start exploring shortcuts and confusing things.</p>

<h2><b>What is Sass?</b></h2>

<p><b>Sass is arguably the most useful of all CSS extensions</b></p>

<p>Sass (which stands for 'Syntactically awesome style sheets) is an extension of CSS that enables you<br> to use things like variables, nested rules, inline imports and more. It also helps to keep things<br> organised and allows you to create style sheets faster.</p>

<p>Sass is compatible with all versions of CSS. The only requirement for using it is that you must have<br> Ruby installed. Users are also asked to follow the Sass Community Guidelines.</p>

<h2><b>How to use Sass?</b></h2>

<p>In the following section, we'll outline some basic tips for using Sass, using examples from the<br> official Sass website. Take a look at the Sass Documentation for additional references and<br> examples.</p>

<h2><b>Syntax</b></h2>

<p><b>Sass includes two syntax options:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>SCSS (Sassy CSS): Uses the .scss file extension and is fully compliant with CSS syntax</li>
<li>Indented (simply called 'Sass'): Uses .sass file extension and indentation rather than<br> brackets; it is not fully compliant with CSS syntax, but it's quicker to write</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Note that files can be converted from one syntax to the other using the sass-convert command.</i></p>

<h2><b>Variables</b></h2>

<p>Just like other programming languages, Sass allows the use of variables that can store information<br> you can use throughout your style sheet. For example, you can store a colour value in a variable at<br> the top of the file, and then use this variable when setting the colour of your elements. This enables<br> you to quickly change your colours without having to modify each line separately.</p>

<p><b>For example:</b></p>
<div>
<p class="code"><i>$font-stack:    Helvetica, sans-serif;<br>
$primary-color: #333;<br><br>

body {<br>
  font: 100% $font-stack;<br>
  color: $primary-color;<br>
}<br><br>

The following CSS will be produced:<br><br>

body {<br>
  font: 100% Helvetica, sans-serif;<br>
  color: #333;<br>
}
</i></p>
</div>
<h2><b>Nesting</b></h2>

<p>Nesting is a double-edged sword. While it provides an excellent method for reducing the amount of<br> code you need to write, it can also lead to over-qualified CSS if not executed carefully. The idea is<br> to nest your CSS selectors in such a way as to mimic your HTML hierarchy.</p>

<p>The following shows a basic navigation style that uses nesting:</p>
<div>
<p class="code"><i>nav {<br>
  ul {<br>
    margin: 0;<br>
    padding: 0;<br>
    list-style: none;<br>
  }<br><br>

  li { display: inline-block; }<br><br>

  a {<br>
    display: block;<br>
    padding: 6px 12px;<br>
    text-decoration: none;<br>
  }<br>
}
</i></p>
</div>
<p><b>The CSS output is as follows:</b></p>
<div>
<p class="code"><i>nav ul {<br>
  margin: 0;<br>
  padding: 0;<br>
  list-style: none;<br>
}<br><br>

nav li {<br>
  display: inline-block;<br>
}<br><br>

nav a {<br>
  display: block;<br>
  padding: 6px 12px;<br>
  text-decoration: none;<br>
}
</i></p>
</div>
<h2><b>Partials</b></h2>

<p>Partials are smaller Sass files that can be imported (see next section) into other Sass files. Think of<br> partials as code snippets. With these code snippets, your CSS can now be modular and easier to<br> maintain. A partial is designated as such by naming it with a leading underscore: _partial.scss.<br>
Import
</p>

<p>Used with Partials (see previous section), the @import directive allows you to import your partial<br> files into the current file, to build one single CSS file. Be mindful of how many imports you're<br> using as an HTTP request will be generated for each one.</p>
<div>
<p class="code"><i>// _reset.scss<br><br>

html,<br>
body,<br>
ul,<br>
ol {<br>
   margin: 0;<br>
  padding: 0;<br>
}<br><br>

// basefile.scss<br><br>

@import 'reset';<br><br>

body {<br>
  font: 100% Helvetica, sans-serif;<br>
  background-color: #efefef;<br>
}
</i></p>
</div>

<p>And the corresponding CSS output:</p>
<div>
<p class="code"><i>
html, body, ul, ol {<br>
  margin: 0;<br>
  padding: 0;<br>
}<br><br>

body {<br>
  font: 100% Helvetica, sans-serif;<br>
  background-color: #efefef;<br>
}<br><br>

Note: When importing partials, you don't need to include the file extension or the underscore.
</i></p>
</div>
<h2><b>Mixins</b></h2>

<p><b>One of the advantages of using preprocessors is their ability to take complex, long-winded<br> code and simplify it. This is where mixins come in handy! </b></p>

<p>For example, if you need to include the vendor prefixes, you can use a mixin instead. Take a look at<br> this example for border-radius:</p>
<div>
<p class="code"><i>@mixin border-radius($radius) {<br>
  -webkit-border-radius: $radius;<br>
     -moz-border-radius: $radius;<br>
      -ms-border-radius: $radius;<br>
          border-radius: $radius;<br>
}<br><br>

.box { @include border-radius(10px); }
</i></p>
</div>
<p>Notice the @mixin directive at the top. It has been given the name border-radius and uses the<br> variable $radius as its parameter. This variable is used to set the radius value for each element. </p>

<p>Later, the @include directive is called, along with the mixin name (border-radius) and a parameter<br> (10px). Thus .box { @include border-radius(10px); }.</p>

<p><b>The following CSS is produced:</b></p>
<div>
<p class="code"><i>.box {<br>
  -webkit-border-radius: 10px;<br>
  -moz-border-radius: 10px;<br>
  -ms-border-radius: 10px;<br>
  border-radius: 10px;<br>
}
</i></p>
</div>
<h2><b>Extend/Inheritance</b></h2>

<p>The @extend directive has been called one of Sass' most powerful features. After seeing it in action,<br> it's clear why.</p>

<p>The idea is that with this directive you won't have to include multiple class names on your HTML<br> elements and can keep your code DRY (don't repeat yourself). Your selectors can inherit the styles<br> of other selectors, and then be easily extended when required. Now that's powerful.</p>

<h2><b>Operators</b></h2>

<p>Having the ability to perform calculations in your CSS allows you to do more, like convert pixel<br> values into percentages. You'll have access to standard maths functions like addition, subtraction,<br> multiplication and division. Of course, these functions can be combined to create complex<br> calculations.</p>

<p>In addition, Sass includes a few built-in functions to help manipulate numbers. Functions like<br> percentage(), floor() and round() to name a few.</p>
